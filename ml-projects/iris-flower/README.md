🌸 Iris Flower Classification

This is my **first machine learning project**, built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
It uses the **Iris dataset** to classify flowers based on their measurements.

🧠 What it Does
The model learns how to predict the type of Iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using:
- Petal length and width
- Sepal length and width

⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

📊 Algorithms Tried
- Decision Tree Classifier ✅
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier ✅

🔍 Results
Achieved up to **100% accuracy** on test data 🎯

📝 How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Open the `.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter
3. Run the cells one by one
