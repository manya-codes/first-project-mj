🌸 Iris Flower Classification - ML Journey with KNN & Decision Tree

My first Machine Learning project where I explore the Iris flower dataset using two classic classification algorithms:
- Decision Tree and
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

I’ve documented every improvement step-by-step, from basic output to clean, readable, and human-friendly results.

🧠 What is the Iris Dataset?
It’s a classic dataset used in ML containing:
- 150 rows of flower data
- 3 classes of flowers: setosa, versicolor, virginica
- 4 features: sepal length/width, petal length/width


💡 Project Evolution (and Learning)
| Version | What's New                                    | Why It Matters                             |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `v1`    | ✅ Used `DecisionTreeClassifier`               | Got first working model with high accuracy |
| `v2`    | 🔄 Switched to `KNN`                          | Explored another popular algorithm         |
| `v3`    | 📝 Converted output numbers to flower names   | Made results human-readable                |
| `v4`    | 🧹 Removed `np.str_()` artifacts              | Cleaned the output formatting              |
| `v5`    | 📊 Used `pandas` to show a side-by-side table | Professional & presentation-ready          |


📊 Model Performance
- Accuracy: 100% on test set
- Visualization: Side-by-side scatter plots for actual vs predicted flower types
- Table view: Added using "pandas" for clearer comparison


🔧 How to Run
- Clone this repo or download ZIP
- Install the required libraries:
"pip install scikit-learn pandas matplotlib"
- Open any notebook in Jupyter:
jupyter notebook
- Explore different versions to see how the project evolves
- Run the cells one by one


👩🏻‍💻 Author
made with love and deep curiosity by Manya Jain, just out of school not in any college yet hahah
guided through steps by ChatGPT, understood and improved the codes by myself


🔍 Results
Achieved up to **100% accuracy** on test data 🎯


and that's it hope you liked the visit! just like everyone else, this was my first ML project, on iris flower classification.
